# Evolutionary-Computation
A brief intrduction to the code

1.run main.py adjust loop and population size to get different result without log

2.run logfile get the log files of the first 8 data sets (withour pcb442 and pr2392 
because they are too big). Log files are in 10datasets/log_file folder and you can see 
the show the overall optimisation of 100 generations

3.experiment1.txt and experiment2.txt contain the results of exercise 5

4.run TSPProblem.py to read data from the file and generate position pool and distance
matrix

5.mutation.py contains different mutation operators

6.crossover.py contains different crossover operators

7.selection.py contains different selection strategy

8.solution.py is a class used to create a possible solution to the problem. Solution is initialized
with random permutation
